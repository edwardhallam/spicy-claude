## Important Testing Notes

1. DANGEROUS MODE is the primary feature to test
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+M three times (or click mode button 3 times)
   - Look for RED visual warnings (badge, border, button text)
   - Test that it ACTUALLY bypasses permissions

2. iOS Safari testing is CRITICAL
   - User will primarily access from mobile
   - Test all modes work on touch interface
   - Verify layout is responsive

3. Test with SAFE commands first:
   - "List files in /tmp"
   - "Create /tmp/test-file.txt"
   - DO NOT test with system-critical commands until verified working

## Quick Test Command
curl -s http://localhost:3456/ | grep -i "title"
Expected: <title>Spicy Claude</title>
